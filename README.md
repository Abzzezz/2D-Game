# 2D-Game "PONG!"


This little 2D Game "PONG!" is a Java based game, made from scratch with LWJGL und Slick2D.
Although this is my first project with the Lightweight Java Game Library, I have been coding with Java since 1.5 years.

Feel free to check out my Trello where I update the coding state almost daily.
